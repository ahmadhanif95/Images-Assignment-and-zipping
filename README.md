# Image Assignment and Zipping Task

## Introduction
This repository contains Python scripts to assign and zip images for cleaning purposes. The task involves dividing a large collection of images into smaller folders and then compressing these folders into zip files. This can be useful for distributing image cleaning tasks among multiple students or collaborators.

## Usage

### 1. Setup
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

### 2. Running the Scripts

#### `new22.py`
This script creates multiple folders and assigns images to each folder from a source directory.

```bash
python new22.py
```

#### `zip.py`
After running `new22.py`, you can use `zip.py` to zip all the generated folders into a single zip file.

```bash
python zip.py
```

### 3. Repository Structure
- **`new22.py`**: Python script to create folders and assign images.
- **`zip.py`**: Python script to zip the generated folders.
- **`images/`**: Directory containing the source images.
- **`output/`**: Directory where the folders with assigned images will be created.
- **`assignment.zip`**: Compressed zip file containing all the folders with assigned images.

### 4. Assignment Details
Each student will receive a zip file containing a specific number of folders with images assigned for cleaning. The number of images assigned to each student is customizable by modifying the variables in `new22.py`.
